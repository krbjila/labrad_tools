The sequencer unit in the design operates by comparing time stamps in a
table to a timer unit. The timer is running at a frequency of 153.6
MHz, resulting in a time increment of ~6.51 ns. A second, on the other
hand corresponds to an increment of 153 600 000 or 0x927C000 in hex. To
allow for long experiments to be timed without overflow, 48 bits are
used to store these time stamps. This allows for experiments as long as
21 days.
In addition to the 48 bits used for time there is a special bit, bit 49,
which is used to encode for "do this when the next high trigger is
observed". Until then the sequencer will not continue on. Once the
trigger is received the sequencer will start counting up again from a
value of 0 such that subsequent times are referenced to the trigger
event.

The sequencer can be triggered from the hardware trigger input to the
box. In addition, a software trigger is available to facilitate
testing. To trigger the sequencer through the software trigger send a
message of 0xA200 over the network interface.

The message format for all remaining messages starts with a 0xA1 byte.
It it then followed by 4 bits selecting the memory used and another 4
bits that encode for the channel (i.e. 0,1,2,3). Each one of the
channels, in turn, has four memories:

0) Low 32 bits of the time stamp.
1) Upper 32 bits of the time stamp.
2) The 32 bit frequency tuning word.
3) Two unused bits | 2 bits to indicate phase updates
   | 12 bits of a phase word | 16 bit amplitude.

The lower bit is for absolute phase updates. In this mode that phase
accumulator gets set to the value provided in the PTW.
The higher bit is for relative phase updates. In this mode that phase
accumulator gets set to its current value plus the PTW.

The FPGA fabric can hold 16384 entries for the sequencer table. This
results in a 14 bit address space for these timestamps. We have 16 bits
allocated in the messages, therefore the uppermost 2 bits are not used
and can be set to 0.

The messages will then be of the format
0xss mc aaaa xxxxxxxx
where ss is our fixed start bit (A1), m is the selected memory (0123),
c is the selected channel (0123), aaaa is the address of the time stamp
to be programmed and xxxxxxxx is the 32-bit word that will be stored in
the memory.

Below are four messages that can be send to program the sequencer to
change output at the trigger (time equals 0), with a phase update,
zero phase (0x000), maximum aplitude (0xFFFF) and a frequency of
268.8 MHz (0xDFFFFFF) at memory address 0000:

A1000000 00000000
A1100000 00000000
A1200000 DFFFFFFF
A1300000 1000FFFF

Calculating the frequency:
The frequency f of the output tone is given by
f = FTW*307.2 MHz / 2^32
So the FTW is
FTW = 2^32 * f / 307.2 MHz

The final entry in each one of the sequencer tables should be all zeroes.
When this special stamp is hit the sequencer run will terminate and
the box will wait idle for the next trigger event to start the sequence
from the beginning.
For example, the below block puts the termination sequencer into memory
slot 4 for the first channel:
A1000004 00000000
A1100004 00000000
A1200004 00000000
A1300004 00000000

Should the sequencer ever get hung up, for instance due to a missing
termination stamp or a timestamp that by error is too far (like a few
hours or so) in the future, the sequencer can be reset by sending a
message of 0xA300 over the network interface.

GPIO outputs have been added to the sequencer. Since only two additional
bits are available in the data section of timestamps, we map the 7 GPIO
outputs to bits 62 - 56 of the timestamps for the first channel. Bits
62 - 56 of the remaining three channels have no effect and are not used.
For instance,
A1000000 00000000
A1100000 7F000000
will turn on all GPIO outputs at time 0.

Pins on J55 map as follows:
GPIO bit J55 pin
56       1
57       3
58       5
59       2
60       4
61       6
62       8

Pin 7 is the trigger input.

SD cards can be created following this tutorial:
https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842385/How+to+format+SD+card+for+SD+boot
The key points are that you want a bootable boot partition that is
formatted as FAT file system and a root partition as ext4. Note that
in this project we are only using the boot partition and the only file
on it is our boot.bin file.

2/27/2023 questions:

1) How do you use 4 bits to encode the channel selection?
Four bits means this field can hold values from 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111) where only the first 4 values are used.
So 0000, 0001, 0010 and 0011 are meaningful while the other 12 options are currently ignored.

2) How do you use 4 bits to encode the memory selection for each channel?
Four bits means this field can hold values from 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111) where only the first 4 values are used.
So 0000, 0001, 0010 and 0011 are meaningful while the other 12 options are currently ignored.

3) Should "0xss cm aaaa xxxxxxxx" be "0xss mc aaaa xxxxxxxx"? For instance, in the example message chain,

A1000000 00000000
A1100000 00000000
A1200000 DFFFFFFF
A1300000 1000FFFF

it seems that you are selecting the memory entry before the channel (which is presumably the 0 channel)?

Yes, thank you for pointing that out. I have corrected the file accordingly.

4) How do you encode the wait for trigger? Is it the low time bit that gets set to 1 in the "A100000200010000" message that is in your test Python script that you shared?

Yes, exactly. I have added a paragraph describing this above.

5) As we started discussing together, what is the expected behavior of the awg if it receives a trigger when it is not in the wait for trigger mode?

Currently trigger events when the box is not actively waiting for a trigger are simply ignored. We can modify this behavior to make the box behave in
whatever way best suits your experiment. I am wondering about how these wait events are being handles between channels and in situations where
for instance channels 0,1 and 3 are already waiting for a trigger but channel 2 has not gotten to that point yet. Just let me know what behavior
will be best for you and we'll implement the triggering accordingly.

6) How does the program terminate/what message or string of messages do we need to send to terminate the sequence?

I have added a paragraph above to describe the current termination. Again, we can modify this behavior if something other than the default
better suits your requirements.

7) In your description, you mention that there are 8192 entries for the sequencer. Is this the total number of messages that we can write, or the total number that we can write to each channel, or something else?

Each one of the channels has 8192 entries. The four memories are completely independent of each other, so there is no way to give unused memory from one channel to another one.

8) Is there a way to interrupt the sequence when it is running? For instance, as Cal mentioned in his email about trying the updated FPGA code, we had an issue where the sequence did not seem to terminate, and when we tried to rewrite to it, it actively refused the connection

I have added this for you, please see above.

Update 09/28/2023:

We got 64 bits in the sequencer output.
Currently, 62 bits are used:
61 Phase update relative
60 Phase update absolute
59-48 Phase
47-32 Amplitude
31-0 Frequency

We'll use the two most significant bits for
the new instructions.
Bit 63 indicates control instruction to populate register values
Bit 62 is for compare/jump instructions
Bits 63 AND bit 62 set is for unconditional jump

When the new instructions are used, the meaning of lower bits
changes:
Bits [47:32] are address
Bits [31: 0] are data to be written.

Address 16'h00 - 16'h07 are 8 counter registers. Writing to them sets
their value which is the number of repetitions.

When bit 62 is set, the address encodes for a compare instruction.
If the register value is 0, the sequencer goes to the address stored in
the corresponding jump registers in the range 16'h10 - 16'h17.
If the register value is not zero the sequencer goes to the address
stored in the corresponding mismatch registers in the range
16'h20 - 16'h27.
Both a match and a mismatch will reset the timer value.


Example:
So let's say we have a sequence in addresses 10-30.
We set register 16'h00 to 10 to get 10 repetitions.
Register 16'h10 is set to address 10.
Finally, we set register 16'h20 to address 31 as that's where we go when
the loop is completed.
Executing a jump instruction 64'hC000AADDDD where AA is 0 and DDDD
bits are ignored will jump back to address 10 and decrement the value
in register 16'h00 by one. Once the value of 16'h00 reaches 0, the next
address for the sequencer will be taken from 16'h20. After 10 loops, we
finally end
up at address 31.
